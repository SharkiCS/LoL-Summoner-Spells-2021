# About LoL Summoner Spells 2021

Almost 3 years later from the last LoL Summoner Spell I have decided to create the same project from scratch, the old project code was certainly a mess unlike this one. A program to know the cooldown of enemy summoner spells. I hope you enjoy it.

# Usage.

The use is kinda simple.

1. You need to have your League of Legends game open.
2. Start the program.
3. Wait for the program to detect your Summoner Name. It shouldn't take more than 5 seconds.
4. Get your [Riot api key](https://developer.riotgames.com/) in their website and paste it in the field.
5. Press start and wait for the status to display "Running"

Once you get the status is running you just need to play. Every game it'll show an interface with the champions and their summoner spells.
